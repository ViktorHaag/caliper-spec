      "value": "A Caliper Event describes a relationship established between an actor and an object.  The relationship is formed as a result of a purposeful action undertaken by the actor in connection to the object at a particular moment. A learner starting an assessment, annotating a reading, pausing a video, or posting a message to a forum, are examples of learning activities that Caliper models as events."
